# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This application is a day scheduler for work hours from nine to five. The current day is displayed at the top of the screen. Tasks to be completed can be placed in each time block, and they are color coded. A row colored gray represents a time block in the past, a red colored row is the current hour and a green colored row represents a time block in the future.

A save button next to each time block will store the info entered in the accompanying text field so that the task is not lost if the page is closed or navigated away from.
